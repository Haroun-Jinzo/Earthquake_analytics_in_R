# Overview

This project analyzes earthquake data from December 1948 in the California-Nevada region.

## Research Questions

1. What is the magnitude distribution of earthquakes?
2. How does distance affect intensity?
3. Are there geographic patterns in the data?
4. What correlations exist between variables?

## Dataset

The dataset contains earthquake observations including:

- Temporal data (date and time)
- Magnitude measurements
- Geographic coordinates (epicenter and stations)
- Distance from epicenter
- Intensity at recording stations
- Location information (states and cities)

## Analysis Steps

1. [Exploratory Analysis](qmd/03-exploratory.qmd) - Visualize patterns
2. [Correlation Analysis](qmd/04-correlations.qmd) - Find relationships
3. [Advanced Visualizations](qmd/06-visualizations.qmd) - Create detailed plots
5. [Conclusions](qmd/07-conclusions.qmd) - Summary and findings

## Key Findings Preview

- Epicenter located near Lake Tahoe (CA/NV border)
- Magnitude 8 earthquake recorded at multiple stations
- Intensity decreases with distance (as expected)
- Activity concentrated over December 28-29, 1948
